# Tic Tac Toe Game (Using Ruby OOP)

## Introduction
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. It's a perfect opportunity to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Ruby and build a fun game!
